Hello world is a tradition to get started with any new programming language. But is there more to it than just tradition ? Maybe hello world is often the most simplistic program one can write in a programing language ( unless you are brainfuck I guess ). It essentially cannot fail. It let's you focus more on the setup required to run the program than to worry if the program is okay. This the reason why all code concepts like loops, conditionals, classes etc.. Use such simple examples, simple code keeps unwanted distractions at bay and let's you focus on what's being discussed. In the case of hello world its not the code that's important its your environment.
